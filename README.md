## Abstract
Bridges in real life vary in structures and materials. Therefore, it is expensive and challenging to develop a single damage detection model that produces great results on every bridge. The inherent differences on structures have given rise to many studies on transfer learning models that can be trained on a given bridge to analyze the sensor signals of a new bridge. As part of the ongoing expansion of this line of work, this study seeks to evaluate a transfer learning technique called Joint Distribution Adaptation on a dataset of acceleration measurements in a binary damage detection classification task. This technique has previously been showed to produced improved precision on a similar task from Gardner et al [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088832701930771X), and we want to examine its performance on our own data. The dataset in the study was provided by University of Hampshire Civil Engineering department. We analyze the strengths and drawbacks of our model, with a view to guiding the next steps of this study in the direction of developing a generalizable, trustworthy classifier for damage detection on bridges.
